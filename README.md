Please create a newsfeed:

Please build an app (iOS or Android) that utilizes a news feed from an api of your choice. The app should display the news feed on open, and clicking items from the news feed should open them up in the default browser.

Design/content is up to the freelancer. Please push the application to github so that our team may test.
